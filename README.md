# PhoneFindr

This Android app helps you find your phone if you misplaced it. If it gets stolen it might still
do what it's supposed to do but we don't guarantee it because the phone might have been turned off or location disabled.

Install it. Sign up/sign in. 
As long as you are signed in on the app, you can always go to the website at anytime and login and click 
on either 'Make Phone Ring' or 'Show Phone's Location'.
